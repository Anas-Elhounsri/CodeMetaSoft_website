Hello everyone, my name is Daniel Garijo from Universidad Polit√©cnica of Madrid, and I am one of the leads involved in the OSCARS CodemetaSOFT project, co-led with Thomas Villaume from the Annecy Particle Physics Lab at CNRS in France

In Codemetasoft  we have three main objectives
  - First, we will ease the adoption of codemeta as a common metadata interchange format across RS software repositories by making it easier to populate and maintain records. For this we aim to do an analysis of the existing metadata adoption practices to detect existing gaps. 
  - Second, we aim to ensure RS metadata consistency, by making sure the metadata records are connected with existing infrastructures and using the right identifiers (for licenses, orcid for people, etc.)
  - Finally, we will propose automated suggestions integrated with good practices for continuous integration such as GitHub actions

We will carry out our analysis within all OSCARS clusters, and, in particular, the ESCAPE Open source Software and Service Repository (OSSR) which will serve as a use-case to test our techniques and to provide feedback.

If you want to know more updates, we will set up a project website soon, so stay tuned.
```
